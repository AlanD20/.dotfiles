# Workspace Setup

In this directory, you may find workspace setup and guides to install programs
as well as OS installations.

Available guides:

- [Arch Installation](ARCH-INSTALLATION.md)

Want to install another desktop/window environment? Take a look at
[archinstall profiles](https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall/tree/master/archinstall/default_profiles).
It's a good start to install necessary packages for each environment.
