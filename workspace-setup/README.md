# Workspace Setup

In this directory, you may find workspace setup and guides to install programs
as well as OS installations.

Available guides:

- [Arch Installation](ARCH-INSTALLATION.md)
- [Display Servers](DISPLAY-SERVERS.md)
- [THEME Configuration](THEME.md)
- [Swaywm](SWAYWM.md)
- [KDE](KDE.md)
- [Applications](APPLICATIONS.md)

Want to install another desktop/window environment? Take a look at
[archinstall profiles](https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall/tree/master/archinstall/default_profiles).
It's a good start to install necessary packages for each environment.
