### Idle configuration
#
# Example configuration:
#
# exec swayidle -w \
#          timeout 5 'swaylock -f' \
#          timeout 10 'swaymsg "output * power off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * power on"' \
#          before-sleep 'swaylock -f'
#
# This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.
